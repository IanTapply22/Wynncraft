# Parties
Parties are a vital part of the social network of Wynncraft. Parties are a great way to privately messages players in a group and to share XP when mobs are killed.

All party members and their statuses are displayed in the scoreboard on the right side of the screen. This displays each member's current health and level, as well as the total level of the party.
