# Tags
Tags exist to identify special players of the Wynncraft content team.
The tag is after the level, the class, and guild of the player ([Lvl/Class/Guild] [Tag]).
If you don't have any tag, you will receive the tag of your rank, if you are not VIP or higher you will not have a tag.
Star tags also exist to represent the importance of a content team member or a moderator. If they exist, they will appear
behind the tags of the player ([Lvl/Class/Guild] [Star Tag] [Tag]).
